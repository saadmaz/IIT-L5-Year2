# Week 01: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

- **OOP Definition:**  
  A programming paradigm that uses "objects"—data structures consisting of fields (attributes) and methods (functions)—to design applications and programs.
- **Goal:**  
  To model real-world entities using code, making software easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.
- **Real-Life Example:**  
  A “Car” object has properties (color, model, speed) and behaviors (drive, brake, honk).

## Key Concepts of OOP

### 1. Classes and Objects

- **Class:**  
  The blueprint or template for objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors but is not an instance itself.  
  *Example:* "Car" is a class.
- **Object:**  
  An instance of a class. Each object has its own data for the attributes defined by the class.  
  *Example:* Your red Toyota is an object of the "Car" class.

**Real-Life Example:**  
- *Class:* Recipe for a cake  
- *Object:* The actual cake you bake from the recipe

---

### 2. Attributes and Methods

- **Attribute (Field):**  
  A variable contained in an object, representing its data.  
  *Example:* A car’s color or number of doors.
- **Method:**  
  A function defined inside a class that describes an action or behavior.  
  *Example:* A car’s "drive" or "brake" function.

**Real-Life Example:**  
- *Attribute:* Your phone’s battery percentage  
- *Method:* The phone’s “make a call” function

### 3. Encapsulation

- **Definition:**  
  The practice of bundling data (attributes) and code (methods) together and restricting access to some of the object's components.
- **Benefit:**  
  Protects data integrity and hides internal object details.
- **Real-Life Example:**  
  A remote control: You interact with buttons, not the internal circuitry.

---

### 4. Inheritance

- **Definition:**  
  Creating new classes from existing ones, inheriting their attributes and behaviors.
- **Benefit:**  
  Promotes code reuse, reduces duplication.
- **Real-Life Example:**  
  A “Truck” class can inherit from a “Vehicle” class, gaining its properties and methods.

---

### 5. Polymorphism

- **Definition:**  
  The ability of different objects to respond uniquely to the same method call.
- **Benefit:**  
  Increases flexibility and integration in code.
- **Real-Life Example:**  
  The “draw()” method can be used for many shapes (circle, triangle, square), but each draws itself differently.

---

### 6. Abstraction

- **Definition:**  
  Hides complex implementation details, exposing only the necessary parts.
- **Benefit:**  
  Simplifies how you interact with objects.
- **Real-Life Example:**  
  Driving a car: You use the controls, not the engine internals.

## Why Use OOP?

- Makes code more maintainable and easier to modify.
- Helps manage complexity in large programs.
- Allows for code reuse with inheritance.
- Models real-world problems naturally.

## OOP Concepts Table

| OOP Concept   | Definition                                    | Real-Life Example              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Class         | Blueprint for objects                         | Recipe for a cake             |
| Object        | Instance of a class                           | Actual cake                   |
| Attribute     | Data about the object                         | Phone’s battery level         |
| Method        | Action the object can perform                 | Phone’s “make a call”         |
| Encapsulation | Keeping data and methods together             | Remote control                |
| Inheritance   | Creating new classes from existing ones       | Truck inherits from Vehicle   |
| Polymorphism  | Same interface, different implementation      | “draw()” for shapes           |
| Abstraction   | Hiding details, showing essentials            | Car controls                  |

## Practice Exercise

1. Think of an everyday object (e.g. book, smartphone, bicycle).
2. Identify possible attributes (what describes it?) and methods (what can it do?).
3. Try to write a simple class definition in your preferred programming language.
